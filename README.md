# iupac-names

Project that collects all possible used [IUPAC names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IUPAC_nomenclature_of_chemistry)
in literature into a [CCZero](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) database. Every
contributor guarantees that the contribution is CCZero and void of any legal claim otherwise.
Autogenerated IUPAC names are forbidden and the IUPAC name must be found in literature. The latter
includes the IUPAC names to be part of larger names, but a valid IUPAC name by itself.
Zero metadata on the origin of the IUPAC name is recorded, and just the existence that the
IUPAC name exists is the copyright-free fact we are recording here.

Our ambition is to have 1M IUPAC names within the first year.

This repository is very simple, consists of a single, sorted list of IUPAC names in the `iupac-names.txt` file.
Each line in that file is a valid IUPAC names, as defined by [OPSIN](https://opsin.ch.cam.ac.uk/)
being able to generate a [SMILES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simplified_Molecular_Input_Line_Entry_System)
string from it.

## Adding new names

The list is sort and contains only unique names. On GNU/Linux, the reference algorithm for this
process is:

```shell
sort -f iupac-names.txt | uniq -i | tee tmp.txt | wc -l ; mv tmp.txt iupac-names.txt
```

## Calculating unique InChIKeys

As an idea of the chemical space covered, we can check the number of unique InChIKeys (mind the
tautomerism normalization):

```
groovy extractInChIKeys.groovy | sort | uniq | wc -l
```
